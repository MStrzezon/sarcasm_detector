# Sarcasm Detector using TensorFlow

This project aims to build a sarcasm detector using the "News Headlines dataset for Sarcasm Detection." It utilizes the TensorFlow library, a popular open-source machine learning framework, to train and evaluate a model capable of detecting sarcasm in news headlines.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "News Headlines dataset for Sarcasm Detection." It is a collection of news headlines labeled with their corresponding sarcasm status (sarcasm or non-sarcasm). The dataset provides a valuable resource for training a machine learning model to recognize sarcasm in text.
